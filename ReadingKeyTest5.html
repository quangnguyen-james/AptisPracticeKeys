            <h2>Reading Question 4 of 5: express their opinions about technology.</h2>
            <p>Four people express their opinions about technology. Read their comments and answer the questions below.</p>
            <p><strong>Jose:</strong> I moved to a new country and it is challenging to stay in touch with relatives, but thanks to technology, I can now easily contact my family. I rely on technology a lot for this reason, and I believe many people nowadays depend on it too. It makes sense, and I have no issues with that. Technology has made staying connected much more convenient and accessible for all of us.</p>
            <p><strong>Marisol:</strong> I work in finance and it is normal for me to use technology to update international banking information and I am an accountant. However, looking at the screen for too long makes my eyes hurt. Also, using my phone for extended periods before bedtime affects my sleep, so I avoid it after 9 p.m. to ensure a good night's rest.</p>
            <p><strong>Bao:</strong> Our family uses technology a lot. My sister called mom even inside the house! Although my dad told us not to use the phone at night, I use it anyway. I find it convenient to watch movies and listen to music. I also use it to play games with friends. My friends always have the most updated games, which puts pressure on me to buy the latest as soon as I can. I don't want to lag behind them.</p>
            <p><strong>Sira:</strong> I am a professional painter, which is not traditionally connected to technology, but perhaps I will use it more in the future. I have a laptop at home. Whenever I use it, my daughter becomes really interested, so I have to keep it locked away. Although some of my friends are keen on let children exposed to technology, I think it would have effect on their brain development.</p>

        <section id="q5" class="question">
            <h2>Reading Question 5 of 5: Renting a Hotel as a Home</h2>
            <p>Read the passage quickly. Choose a heading for each numbered paragraph (1-7) from the drop-down box. There is one more heading than you need.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">1. [A Financial Viable Solution]</strong><br>
		        1. In today's world, many individuals are opting to live in hotels because it is more affordable than renting a house. The cost of renting a hotel covers all expenses, including water, electricity and even meals, often surpassing what traditional homes offer. Moreover, residents have the opportunity to negotiate long-term stays with hotel managers, making hotel living more cost-effective compared to renting a house.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">2. [The Price of Convenience is High]</strong><br> 
		        2. While it may seem convenient to have meals readily available with private chefs in hotel restaurants, there are potential downsides to consider. Reliance on outside food options can impact health. Hotel meals often prioritize convenience over nutrition, which can lead to an unhealthy diet. This, in turn, may result in weight gain and nutrient deficiencies, leading to various health issues. As a result, you can have suffered from medical bills in the long term – if you use the food in the restaurant cooked by chief.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">3. [The Importance of Planning in Advance]</strong><br>
                3. Moving to a hotel for an extended period requires careful planning and preparation. It's not a decision that can be made overnight. Individuals need to consider what belongings to bring, how to transport them, and how to organize their new living space. It's important to prioritize essential items and leave behind what is not necessary. By planning ahead, individuals can ensure a smooth transition to hotel living, avoiding unnecessary stress and disruptions.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">4. [The Impact of Losing Freedom]</strong><br>
                4. Living in a hotel comes with certain rules and regulations that residents must follow. They have to adapt to the hotel’s policies and accommodate different lifestyles of fellow residents. This can sometimes mean compromising personal preferences to maintain harmony within the hotel environment. While there may be a loss of certain freedoms compared to living in a house, the trade-off is the convenience and services provided by the hotel.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">5. [The Benefits of Living Less]</strong><br>
                5. Choosing to live in a hotel instead of renting a house often means downsizing and living with fewer possessions. This can bring various benefits, such as reduced clutter, easier maintenance, and a simplified lifestyle. Living with less can also lead to greater flexibility and mobility, as individuals are not tied down to a specific location or burdened with extensive belongings. Embracing a minimalist approach can enhance a sense of freedom and offer a more streamlined living experience.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">6. [The Challenges that Come with a New Perspective]</strong><br>
                6. Adjusting to hotel living can be tough, but it brings fresh outlooks. Living with less in a smaller space allows residents to focus on experiences instead of stuff, leading to a simpler and more flexible lifestyle. Plus, being in a hotel exposes people to different cultures and diverse individuals, broadening their minds and promoting openness. This change in perspective encourages personal growth, adaptability, and a deeper appreciation for the transient nature of life.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">7. [Competitive Business]</strong><br>
                7. As the trend of living in hotels becomes increasingly popular, the hotel industry faces growing competition. Hotels must continually enhance their offerings and services to attract guests and secure their position in the market. The future of hotel living is predicted to be a competitive arena, as establishments strive to captivate customers and meet their evolving needs and preferences. This competition benefits consumers, as it fosters innovation and ensures a diverse range of hotel options to choose from.</p>
