                            1. In the picture, I can see a shopping street.<br> 
                            There are not many people walking; some of them are carrying bags, and others are looking into shop windows.<br> 
                            The place doesn't look crowded but seems full of energy. I think it could be outside of a shopping mall.<br> 
                            The weather seems bright and clear, which makes the atmosphere more lively.<br> 
                            Overall, it looks like a popular place for shopping and meeting friends.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. The last time I went shopping was about two weeks ago.<br> 
                            I went with my children to the Go supermarket near my house.<br> 
                            We needed to buy some clothes for our children and also some groceries for the week.<br> 
                            After shopping, we decided to have lunch in a small restaurant inside the mall.<br> 
                            It was a little crowded, but we still enjoyed the time together.<br> 
                            Shopping can be tiring, but it is also a good way to spend time with family.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. I think some people dislike busy places because they feel uncomfortable with too much noise and too many people around.<br> 
                            It can be stressful to wait in long lines or to move slowly in the crowd.<br> 
                            Some people prefer quiet places where they can relax and enjoy peace.<br> 
                            Also, busy areas can sometimes be hot or unsafe, especially if there are pickpockets.<br>
                             Personally, I don’t mind going to crowded places sometimes, but I prefer calm areas when I feel tired or need to focus.<br>

                            1. In the picture I can see several people sitting on a bus.<br> 
                            The bus is not very crowded and most of the passengers look young.<br> 
                            One woman is wearing headphones and smiling brightly.<br> 
                            Some people are looking out of the window and enjoying the view.<br> 
                            A few passengers seem to be sleeping or resting. The overall atmosphere looks calm and relaxed.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. The last time I went on a group trip was last month with my master students to Binh Duong.<br> 
                            We took a taxi and talked a lot during the trip, making the trip feel short.<br> 
                            To prepare for this trip, 2 girls prepared a lot of food for the whole group, they always did their best.<br> 
                            When we arrived, we arranged the place and the necessary things for grilling food, 
                            we grilled together, bathed in the stream, ate the prepared food and joked around while bathing.<br> 
                            It was a very fun and relaxing weekend, bringing us closer.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. Traveling with a group has many advantages.<br> 
                            It usually saves money because people can share transport and accommodation costs.<br> 
                            It also feels safer and more comfortable when you are with friends.<br> 
                            Group trips are more enjoyable since you can share experiences, take photos together, and support each other.<br> 
                            Planning becomes easier because responsibilities are divided among the group.<br> 
                            For me, group travel creates good memories and improve friendships.<br>

                            1. In the picture there are two people standing close together. A woman who looks like a reporter is holding a microphone.<br> 
                            She is interviewing a man who is wearing a suit and tie. Both of them are dressed smartly and look professional.<br> 
                            The background is plain, so the focus is on the interview.<br> 
                            The scene gives a calm and serious feeling and makes me feel curious about the topic they are discussing.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. I prefer watching news on TV or online because it is faster and easier to follow.<br> 
                            I'm very busy because of working and studying, I often do not have much time to read long articles.<br> 
                            Short video clips or headlines give me quick updates I can watch between tasks.<br> 
                            However, when I need more details for work or my master's study, I sometimes read longer articles.<br> 
                            So I use both, but watching news fits my daily routine better.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. People need to watch the news to know what is happening locally and around the world.<br> 
                            News helps us make daily decisions, for example about travel, safety, or work plans.<br> 
                            It also keeps citizens informed about politics and social issues, which is important for participating in society.<br> 
                            For working, news helps us update new things related to our work and give useful information.<br> 
                            Finally, watching the news helps people feel connected to the wider world.<br>

                            They are wearing sports clothes, like T-shirts, shorts, and trainers.<br> 
                            I think they are a father and son. The weather looks sunny and bright, 
                            which makes it a perfect day for sports.<br> 
                            They look active and full of energy. This picture gives me a happy feeling about family affection.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. The last time I played sports was about a month ago with some of my friends.<br> 
                            We played badminton in a small sports center near my house.<br> 
                            I like badminton because it is easy to play and does not take too much time.<br> 
                            We laughed a lot during the game, even when we made mistakes.<br> 
                            After playing, we sat together, drank water, and talked about work and family.<br> 
                            It was fun and also good exercise for my health.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. I think people should play sports because it helps them stay healthy and strong.<br> 
                            Sports also reduce stress, which is very important for people who work long hours like me.<br> 
                            Playing sports with friends can improve relationships and create happy memories.<br> 
                            It also teaches teamwork, discipline, and patience.<br> 
                            For children, sports are important for their growth and social skills.<br> 
                            In general, playing sports is good for both body and mind.<br>

                            1. In the picture I can see a group of friends sitting in a restaurant.<br> 
                            They are sitting around a table and talking happily. Some of them are eating, while others are drinking.<br> 
                            The people look young and relaxed, maybe they are students or colleagues.<br> 
                            The atmosphere seems friendly and warm, and the place looks comfortable.<br> 
                            This picture makes me think of spending good time with my own friends.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. The last time I went to a restaurant with my friends was about three weeks ago.<br> 
                            I met my classmates from the master’s program in a small restaurant.<br> 
                            We ordered some Vietnamese food and shared many dishes together.<br> 
                            While eating, we laughed, told stories, and enjoyed the time.<br> 
                            After the meal, we went for coffee and continued our chat.<br> 
                            It was really fun and made me feel more connected with them.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. I think people enjoy eating out with friends because it is a good way to relax after work or study.<br> 
                            At a restaurant, nobody has to cook or clean, so everyone can just focus on enjoying the food.<br> 
                            Eating together also creates a friendly atmosphere where people can share stories and jokes.<br> 
                            It is a chance to try new dishes that maybe you cannot cook at home.<br> 
                            Most importantly, it helps people feel closer and build stronger relationships.<br>

                            They look young, maybe friends or classmates. Everyone is laughing loudly and seems very happy.<br>

                            2. One time I laughed a lot was last year at a birthday party of my classmate.<br> 
                            It was in a small café after the dinner, and I went there with my master’s group.<br> 
                            During that time, we talked a lot of funny things related to  work, family and study.<br> 
                            Everyone laughed so much that our faces turned red. The atmosphere was full of energy and happiness.<br> 
                            I felt very relaxed and forgot all the stress from everything at that moment.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. Yes, I think people from different countries laugh at different things.<br> 
                            Humor depends on culture, language, and lifestyle.<br> 
                            For example, some people like jokes about daily life, while others enjoy wordplay or funny stories.<br> 
                            In some cultures, people laugh at physical comedy, while in others they prefer clever jokes.<br> 
                            But in the end, everyone likes to laugh because it makes life lighter, 
                            laughter is a common language for all people.<br>

                            The place looks bright, clean, and well organized. There are many colorful items around her, like food and drinks.<br>

                            2. The last time I went to the supermarket was last weekend with my family.<br> 
                            We went to a big supermarket near our house, it's called Go supermarket.<br> 
                            We bought fruits, vegetables, and food for my children.<br> 
                            After paying, we stopped at a small café inside to drink coffee.<br> 
                            It was a simple trip, but it was nice to spend time together.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. Yes, I often go shopping in the supermarket, usually once or twice a month.<br> 
                            It is convenient because everything is in one place and I can buy what I need.<br> 
                            Supermarkets also have promotions, so I can save money on some products.<br> 
                            I usually go with my family. Sometimes it is crowded, but I don’t mind because it is my happy time with my family.<br> 
                            For me, supermarket shopping is part of my family routine.<br>

                            2. The last time I traveled by car was a few months ago with my family.<br> 
                            We went from Ho Chi Minh City to my hometown to visit my mother.<br> 
                            The trip took several hours, but the children were excited to see their grandmother.<br> 
                            On the way, we stopped at a small restaurant to eat and take a short rest.<br> 
                            In the car, we listened to music and sometimes talked about family stories.<br> 
                            It was a long journey, but I felt happy because we were all togethe<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. I think people need to learn how to ride, for example a motorbike or a bicycle, because it makes life easier.<br> 
                            In Vietnam, many people use motorbikes every day to go to work or school.<br> 
                            Riding helps you save time and gives you more freedom to travel.<br> 
                            It is also useful when public transport is not convenient.<br> 
                            Learning to ride is an important skill that most people should have. <br>

                            1. In the picture I can see 2 people playing football. A man and a baby boy, I think they are a father and son.<br> 
                            They are on an outdoor court, wearing sports clothes like T-shirts, shorts, and sneakers.<br> 
                            The father is teaching his son how to play footbal.<br> 
                            The weather looks sunny and bright, so it seems like a perfect day for playing.<br> 
                            They look active and full of energy. This picture makes me feel happy and reminds me of my father.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. The last time I played sports was a few weeks ago with my colleagues.<br> 
                            After work, we went to a small sport center near the office.<br> 
                            We played a friendly match, divided into two teams, and tried our best to win.<br> 
                            Even though we were tired, we laughed and had a lot of fun.<br> 
                            It was a good way to relax and also to build teamwork with my colleagues.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. People should play sports because it is very important for their health.<br> 
                            It helps to keep the body fit and strong, and also reduces stress.<br> 
                            Playing sports can also improve social skills, as people learn teamwork and communication.<br> 
                            For children, sports are useful for their growth and discipline.<br> 
                            For adults, it is a good way to balance work and life.<br> 
                            Overall, sports bring both physical and mental benefits.<br>

                            1. In the picture I can see 2 people inluding a man and a woman in the kitchen preparing food, look like they are couple.<br> 
                            The woman is reading something in a paper, the man is preparing foods.<br> 
                            There are some flowers that look like they are preparing for a small party.<br> 
                            The kitchen is bright and clean, which makes the atmosphere comfortable.<br> 
                            They look happy and excited.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. The last time I prepared a meal was last night for my chidren.<br> 
                            I cooked some fried fish with vegetables and made a small soup.<br> 
                            My children do not always like vegetables, so I tried to cook them in a tasty way.<br> 
                            My son helped me some small things, and we finished the meal together.<br> 
                            When we ate, we enjoyed the food and talked together. It was the happy time of my family.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. I think people eat unhealthy food for several reasons.<br> 
                            First, fast food is often cheaper and more convenient, especially for busy people.<br> 
                            Second, unhealthy food usually tastes good and is hard to resist.<br> 
                            Sometimes people are tired and do not want to cook, so they just buy ready-made meals.<br> 
                            Even though people know it is not good, they still choose it for comfortable .<br>

                            1. In the photo, I see three people sitting on the bus. All of them are old and wearing masks.<br> 
                            Two are reading something that seems to be a newspaper, and another person seems to be sleeping.<br> 
                            The bus is not very crowded, and the atmosphere is quiet and comfortable.<br> 
                            The weather outside is clear and sunny. Looking at this photo, I feel calm and peaceful.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. The last time I took a bus was when I went back to my hometown a few months ago.<br> 
                            I took a long-distance bus from Ho Chi Minh City, which took about six hours.<br> 
                            On the bus, I listened to music and sometimes looked out the window to take in the view.<br> 
                            The bus was crowded, but still comfortable enough to rest.<br> 
                            When I arrived, I felt very relaxed because I had arrived.<br> 
                            Although the trip was quite long, I did not feel tired.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. I think there are many ways to avoid boredom on a bus.<br> 
                            People can listen to music or podcasts, which makes the time pass faster.<br> 
                            Reading a book or using a phone to watch videos is also a good choice.<br> 
                            Some people like to chat with friends or other passengers.<br> 
                            Sleeping is another way to save energy during the journey.<br> 
                            Personally, I often sleep to make the trip feel shorter and more enjoyable.<br>

                            My mother asked me about my job, my studies, and my children.<br> 
                            I also listened to her stories about daily life in the countryside.<br> 
                            The conversation was simple but very warm. <br>
                            I always feel relaxed and happy when I talk with my mother.<br>

                            3. Yes, my mother is very important to me.<br> 
                            She has always supported me since I was young and taught me many valuable lessons.<br> 
                            Even now, when I am an adult with my own family, she still gives me advice and encouragement.<br>
                            I admire her patience and kindness.<br> 
                            My mother is one of the most important people in my life, and I try my best to make her proud.<br>

                            1.	Describe the picture<br>
                            2.	Tell me about your favourite program<br>
                            3.	Which is better for studying? Reading or watching?<br>                            
                            </em>
                        </td>
                        <td style="font-size: 14px;">
                            1. In the picture, there is no much objects in, I only can see a hand that look like a man hand.<br> 
                            He is using a TV remote to control or choice the project that he want to watch.<br> 
                            Watching TV is also an daily activity in my family in every night.<br> 
                            I usually watch with my children with some funny programs.<br> 
                            This is very comfortable and relaxed, enjoying time together.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. My favourite program is a daily news show that I often watch on TV.<br> 
                            It update what is happening locally and around the world.<br> 
                            I like it because news helps us make daily decisions, for example about travel, safety, or work plans.<br> 
                            It also keeps citizens informed about politics and social issues, 
                            which is important for participating in society.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. I think both reading and watching can be good for studying, but it depends on the subject.<br> 
                            Reading books or articles gives deeper knowledge and helps improve thinking skills.<br> 
                            Watching videos or programs is faster and more visual, which is useful for practical subjects.<br> 
                            For example, in my work, watching tutorials helps me understand how to apply knowledge.<br> 
                            Personally, I prefer a mix of both because it makes learning more effective.<br>

                            1. In the picture I can see a young man making a phone call.<br> 
                            He is sitting outdoors, look like at a coffee shop.<br> 
                            He looks serious and focused while talking on the phone.<br> 
                            He is wearing casual clothes and there is a laptop in front of him.<br> 
                            The background is bright and quiet, which makes the man stand out.<br> 
                            This picture makes me feel much energy.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. The last phone call I remember was yesterday when I called my colleague.<br> 
                            I wanted to discuss about the project that we are working together.<br> 
                            The call lasted about ten minutes, and we talked about deadlines and some technical problems.<br> 
                            After the call, I felt more confident because we agreed on a clear plan.<br> 
                            Phone calls are very useful for solving things quickly. For me, it is a common part of my job.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. I don't think text messages can replace phone calls in the future.<br> 
                            In the past, text messages were very popular but now phone calls and especially video calls have become really popular. <br>
                            Texting can be unclear for complex topics while phone calls allow people to hear and solve problems faster.<br> 
                            For family and close friends, hearing someone’s voice feels warmer and more personal. <br>

                        <td style="font-size: 14px;">
                            1. In the picture I can see a woman and 3 kids with 2 boys and a girl, 
                            they are in a kitchen that looks like a cooking class.<br> 
                            All of them are wearing red apron and look busy cooking.<br> 
                            On the table, there are some vegetables and cooking tools.<br> 
                            A woman is teaching a boy how to use a knife.<br> 
                            The kitchen looks clean and bright, which gives a comfortable feeling.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. In my culture, most people learn to cook from their family, especially from their mother.<br> 
                            Children often watch and help their parents in the kitchen when they are young.<br> 
                            Later, people also learn from friends, books, or cooking videos online. <br>
                            For me, I learned the basics from my mother, and later I improved by practicing myself.<br> 
                            Cooking is part of our daily life, so everyone learns little by little.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. It is important for people to learn how to cook because it makes them more independent.<br> 
                            Cooking at home is usually healthier and cheaper than eating out.<br>  
                            For families, cooking together can make relationships stronger.<br> 
                            Learning to cook is also a useful life skill that can be passed to children.<br> 
                            Personally, I think cooking is not only practical but also enjoyable.<br>
