            <h2>Reading Question 4 of 5: Volunteering to clean the local park</h2>
            <p>Four people responded to the request from the neighborhood leader for volunteering to clean the local park. Read their answers and answer the questions below.</p>
            <p><strong>Person A:</strong> I just have too much work that I don't have much free time for myself. This tight schedule makes it impossible for me to join in the park cleaning. I work all week, and the only time I go out is on weekends with my family. We usually visit the park to play games and take a walk. I am relieved to hear that the park will be cleaned by the children volunteering from the school nearby. I believe these experiences will benefit them in the future, helping them sharpen skills needed for their future careers.</p>
            <p><strong>Person B:</strong> I adore the gorgeous scenery and fresh air at the park. Therefore, I always bring my family to the park to relax. My husband and I are always willing to do some volunteer work, so I will ask my husband to help out since he usually doesn't do much anyway. I will make specific plans for everyone in the neighborhood to follow so the park could be cleaned in no time.</p>
            <p><strong>Person C:</strong> The park plays an important role in teaching children about responsibility through volunteering. Cleaning the local park not only helps keep the environment clean but also teaches kids the value of teamwork and dedication. We admire their efforts to protect nature, whether it's picking up trash or planting flowers. Volunteering is a great way for children to improve their skills and mindset while making a positive impact on our community.</p>
            <p><strong>Person D:</strong> This is a reminder that not just the park, but other areas in our town also need regular cleaning. Keeping our neighborhoods clean is important for a healthy environment. The community should work together to organize cleaning events more often, as ignoring trash can harm wildlife and make the area unpleasant. By joining these efforts, residents can take pride in their surroundings and make sure everyone has a nice place to enjoy.</p>

        <section id="q5" class="question">
            <h2>Reading Question 5 of 5: Children & Exercise</h2>
            <p>Read the passage quickly. Choose a heading for each numbered paragraph (1-7) from the drop-down box. There is one more heading than you need.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">1. [Factors contributing to inactivity]</strong><br>
		        In recent years, children have become increasingly inactive. While technology often receives blame for this trend, it is not the only factor at play. Urbanization has led to a lack of safe play spaces for kids. Many neighborhoods no longer have parks or playgrounds, forcing children to stay indoors. This combination of screen time and limited physical activity opportunities is contributing to a decline in children's overall fitness and health.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">2. [The situation has the potential to become worse]</strong><br> 
		        Currently, the issue of children not getting enough exercise is worsening, largely due to the time they spend staring at screens. The allure of laptops and smartphones is hard to resist, making it difficult for both parents and children to limit their use. As awareness grows about the importance of physical activity, it is essential for everyone to recognize the seriousness of this problem and work together to find effective solutions that encourage a more active lifestyle.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">3. [The success of a simple idea]</strong><br>
                One inspiring example comes from a teacher who implemented a program called the Daily Mile. Each day, students are encouraged to run at least one mile, and this simple idea quickly gained popularity. It has won awards for its effectiveness and has spread to over 3,500 schools in more than 30 countries, thanks to media coverage and positive testimonials. This initiative highlights how even small changes can have a significant impact on promoting physical activity among children.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">4.[The wider effects of regular exercise]</strong><br>
                The Daily Mile program not only enhances fitness levels among students but also has surprising benefits for their academic performance. Teachers have reported that students participating in this program are more focused and alert during lessons. Psychologists support this observation, suggesting that a healthy body leads to a healthy mind. The saying "a strong body, a strong mind" appears to hold true, as regular physical activity positively influences students' ability to learn and retain information.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">5. [Ways in which environment can influence behaviour]</strong><br>
                The design of our environments can significantly impact how we behave. For instance, workplaces are often designed to enhance productivity, and homes are structured to encourage communication. Similarly, schools can be designed to promote physical activity. By creating spaces that encourage movement, such as open areas for play and exercise, educators can foster a more active lifestyle among students, helping to counteract the trend of inactivity.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">6. [A design for exercise and for study]</strong><br>
                One innovative architect from Japan has designed a kindergarten with a unique approach. The playground is structured like a running track, allowing children to run and play freely. This creative design has proven successful and has even received awards for its impact on children's activity levels. Such thoughtful architectural designs can inspire other schools to rethink how they create environments that promote both learning and physical activity.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">7. [Achieving the right balance]</strong><br>
                The Daily Mile initiative and the Japanese architect's playground represent two ends of the economic spectrum. The Daily Mile is a cost-effective program that requires minimal investment, while the architect's design involves significant funding. Local authorities must consider various factors when striving for a balance between promoting physical activity and managing budgets. By exploring both affordable and innovative solutions, communities can create environments that support children's health and well-being.</p>
