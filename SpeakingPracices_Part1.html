                            1. Yesterday I worked at my office in the morning. <br>
                            I had some meetings with my team because we are developing a new project. <br>
                            In the evening, I spent time with my children. We played together, and I helped them with their homework. <br>
                            After that, I relaxed by watching TV before going to bed.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. I have many friends, but the closest ones are my classmates from my master’s program.<br> 
                            We are from different ages, so our group is very interesting.<br> 
                            We often go out for coffee, have meals, or even sing karaoke together.<br> 
                            They make me feel happy and relaxed after work.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. My favorite movie is Red Rain. I like it because it is interesting and meaningful.<br> 
                            The story is about the history of Vietnam and the soldiers who fought to protect Quang Tri citadel.<br> 
                            I like the special effects and the good coordination between the characters.<br> 
                            I watched this movie with my group of friends, and we all enjoyed it.

                            I like it because it has both beautiful beaches and mountains.<br> 
                            The people are friendly and the food is delicious, especially seafood.<br> 
                            I went there with my family last summer, and we had a great time together.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. My favorite film star is Jackie Chan.<br> 
                            I like him because he is funny and also very talented in action movies.<br> 
                            I enjoy watching his films with my children, and we always laugh a lot.<br> 
                            He is also a good example of hard work and energy.<br>

                            3. The last time I saw an advertisement was on TV. It was about a mobile phone.<br> 
                            The ad showed the new features like a better camera and a long battery life.<br> 
                            I really like it but I do not want to change my phone in this time.<br> 
                            I often use phones for both work and study.

                            People of all ages like to play it, especially in the evenings or at weekends.<br> 
                            Many people also enjoy badminton because it is easy to play in small places.<br> 
                            Some young people go to the gym or play basketball, but football is still number one.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. My favorite place is Ho Chi Minh City because it is where I live and work.<br> 
                            The city is very busy and modern, with many coffee shops and restaurants.<br> 
                            I enjoy going out with my friends to drink coffee or eat together.<br> 
                            Even though the traffic is crowded, I still love this city because it has many opportunities and energy.

                            There are about 30 people and most of them look like serious.<br> 
                            The light is bright, and the walls are plain.<br>  
                            It is a good place for taking a test because it is clean and comfortable.<br>

                            I went with my friends to watch a new movie which many people said that it was very interesting.<br>  
                            The cinema was crowded, but the sound and picture were very good.<br>  
                            All of us were very happy, and we enjoyed it together.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. Today I am wearing a light blue shirt and black trousers.<br> 
                            This is my usual style for work.<br> 
                            I like simple and comfortable clothes,<br> 
                            especially when I have to sit and work for many hours.

                            It is cheap, fast, and easy to move in small streets,<br> 
                            especially in big cities like Ho Chi Minh City.<br>

                            We often eat with chopsticks and share the food on the table. Soup is also common in every meal.<br> 
                            Sometimes we have fish sauce to make the food more tasty.<br>

                            1. In my city, the most popular means of transport is the motorbike.<br> 
                            Almost every family owns at least one, and people use it to go to work, school, or even travel short distances.<br> 
                            Motorbikes are convenient and flexible, especially when the streets are crowded.<br> 
                            Recently, more people have also started using cars, but motorbikes are still the number one choice.<br>

                            It has two floors with a living room, a kitchen, and bedrooms for each family member.<br> 
                            What I like most about my house is the warm atmosphere, 
                            because we usually spend time together in the living room, watching TV or talking.<br> 
                            Although it is not very large, it is really a place where I feel safe and relaxed.<br>

                            The weather there is quite hot and sunny, but in the town center it is comfortable. <br>
                            The environment is peaceful, with many green fields and rivers. 
                            The food is delicious, especially seafood and traditional dishes.<br> 
                            The people are friendly, open, and very hospitable. 
                            Whenever I come back, I feel calm and happy because life there is slower and more relaxing than in big cities.<br>
