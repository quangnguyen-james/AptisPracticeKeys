                            1. Last summer, I had a chance to visit an old friend whom I hadn’t met for a very long time. We spent time going out for drinks, having dinner together, and I also visited his home. We talked a lot about our past memories and shared what was happening in our lives now. <br>
                            2. I felt really happy and relaxed during this visit. Meeting him again reminded me of many good times we had in the past, and it also made me realize how important old friendships are. It was a very meaningful experience for me.<br>
                            3. At the moment, I prefer living in a big city because it provides better education opportunities for my child and more chances for career development. However, in the future, when my child grows up, I would love to return to my hometown. Life there is quieter and more peaceful, which I think is suitable for retirement.

                        2. How do you feel when you work in a team?<br>
                        3. What are the advantages of teamwork?/ affect of a successful team</td>
                        <td>
                            1. Last year, I joined a project at my company where we had to develop a mobile application in only two months. I worked with four other colleagues, and each of us had different skills. My main responsibility was to manage tasks and check progress. We had regular meetings to share updates and solve problems together, which helped us stay on track and complete the project successfully.<br>
                            2. I usually feel motivated and supported when working in a team. I enjoy sharing ideas and listening to different opinions because it helps me learn new perspectives. Sometimes it can be a little stressful if we have disagreements, but overall I feel teamwork makes me more confident and productive.<br>
                            3. I think teamwork has many advantages. First, people can combine their strengths, so the group can achieve goals faster and with better quality. Second, teamwork allows members to learn from one another and improve their skills. Finally, working together creates a sense of belonging and stronger relationships, which is very important for success in both study and work.

                        2. How did you feel?<br>
                        3. Modern life makes us busier and more rushed? what do you think?</td>
                        <td>
                            1. I remember one morning last month when I woke up late because I forgot to set my alarm. I had an important meeting at work, but I only had thirty minutes left to get ready and travel there. I quickly dressed, skipped breakfast, and rushed to catch a taxi. Luckily, I arrived just on time, but it was a stressful experience.<br>
                            2. At that moment, I felt very worry and uncomfortable because I was afraid of being late and making a bad impression. My heart was racing, and I couldn’t think clearly. After the meeting started and I managed to calm down, I felt relieved, but the whole day I was still a bit tired because of the stressful start.<br>
                            3. Yes, I completely agree. In modern life, people often have too many responsibilities such as work, family, and social commitments. Technology helps us save time, but at the same time it creates pressure because we are always connected and expected to respond quickly. I think the key is to manage time better and take breaks when possible, so life feels more balanced.

                        2. What was the most difficult thing for you?<br>
                        3. It is never too old to learn new things. Do you agree or disagree? What do you think?</td>
                        <td>
                            1. Last year, I decided to learn how to cook traditional Vietnamese dishes because I wanted to prepare healthier meals for my family. At first, I followed online videos and sometimes asked my mother for advice. I practiced cooking different dishes every weekend, and slowly I became more confident. It was a new but very enjoyable experience for me.<br>
                            2. The most difficult thing was remembering all the ingredients and the exact steps. Sometimes I forgot small details, and the food didn’t taste as good as I expected. Also, it took me quite a lot of time to prepare everything. However, I learned to be patient and keep practicing, which helped me improve.<br>
                            3. I completely agree. Learning is a lifelong process, and people can always benefit from new knowledge or skills, no matter their age. Older people, for example, can learn to use smartphones to stay connected with their families. I think learning keeps our minds active and helps us enjoy life more.
