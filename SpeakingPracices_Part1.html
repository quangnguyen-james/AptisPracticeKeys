                            1. Yesterday I worked at my office in the morning. <br>
                            I had some meetings with my team because we are developing a new project. <br>
                            In the evening, I spent time with my children. We played together, and I helped them with their homework. <br>
                            After that, I relaxed by watching TV before going to bed.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. I have many friends, but the closest ones are my classmates from my master’s program.<br> 
                            We are from different ages, so our group is very interesting.<br> 
                            We often go out for coffee, have meals, or even sing karaoke together.<br> 
                            They make me feel happy and relaxed after work.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. My favorite movie is Red Rain. I like it because it is interesting and meaningful.<br> 
                            The story is about the history of Vietnam and the soldiers who fought to protect Quang Tri citadel.<br> 
                            I like the special effects and the good coordination between the characters.<br> 
                            I watched this movie with my group of friends, and we all enjoyed it.

                            1. My favorite place is Nha Trang city in Vietnam.<br> 
                            I like it because it has both beautiful beaches and mountains.<br> 
                            The people are friendly and the food is delicious, especially seafood.<br> 
                            I went there with my family last summer, and we had a great time together.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. My favorite film star is Jackie Chan.<br> 
                            I like him because he is funny and also very talented in action movies.<br> 
                            I enjoy watching his films with my children, and we always laugh a lot.<br> 
                            He is also a good example of hard work and energy.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. The last time I saw an advertisement was on TV. It was about a mobile phone.<br> 
                            The ad showed the new features like a better camera and a long battery life.<br> 
                            I really like it but I do not want to change my phone in this time.<br> 
                            I often use phones for both work and study.

                            1. On a typical day, I go to work in the morning. I have meetings with my team and check the progress of our software projects.<br> 
                            In the afternoon, I continue working or studying for my master’s program.<br> 
                            In the evening, I spend time with my children. We play together or I help them with their homework.<br>

                            2. In Vietnam, the most popular sport is football.<br> 
                            People of all ages like to play it, especially in the evenings or at weekends.<br> 
                            Many people also enjoy badminton because it is easy to play in small places.<br> 
                            Some young people go to the gym or play basketball, but football is still number one.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. My favorite place is Ho Chi Minh City because it is where I live and work.<br> 
                            The city is very busy and modern, with many coffee shops and restaurants.<br> 
                            I enjoy going out with my friends to drink coffee or eat together.<br> 
                            Even though the traffic is crowded, I still love this city because it has many opportunities and energy.
