                            1. In the picture, I can see a shopping street.<br> 
                            There are not many people walking; some of them are carrying bags, and others are looking into shop windows.<br> 
                            The place doesn't look crowded but seems full of energy. I think it could be outside of a shopping mall.<br> 
                            The weather seems bright and clear, which makes the atmosphere more lively.<br> 
                            Overall, it looks like a popular place for shopping and meeting friends.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. The last time I went shopping was about two weeks ago.<br> 
                            I went with my children to the Go supermarket near my house.<br> 
                            We needed to buy some clothes for our children and also some groceries for the week.<br> 
                            After shopping, we decided to have lunch in a small restaurant inside the mall.<br> 
                            It was a little crowded, but we still enjoyed the time together.<br> 
                            Shopping can be tiring, but it is also a good way to spend time with family.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. I think some people dislike busy places because they feel uncomfortable with too much noise and too many people around.<br> 
                            It can be stressful to wait in long lines or to move slowly in the crowd.<br> 
                            Some people prefer quiet places where they can relax and enjoy peace.<br> 
                            Also, busy areas can sometimes be hot or unsafe, especially if there are pickpockets.<br>
                             Personally, I don’t mind going to crowded places sometimes, but I prefer calm areas when I feel tired or need to focus.<br>

                            1. In the picture I can see several people sitting on a bus.<br> 
                            The bus is not very crowded and most of the passengers look young.<br> 
                            One woman is wearing headphones and smiling brightly.<br> 
                            Some people are looking out of the window and enjoying the view.<br> 
                            A few passengers seem to be sleeping or resting. The overall atmosphere looks calm and relaxed.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. The last time I went on a group trip was last month with my master students to Binh Duong.<br> 
                            We took a taxi and talked a lot during the trip, making the trip feel short.<br> 
                            To prepare for this trip, 2 girls prepared a lot of food for the whole group, they always did their best.<br> 
                            When we arrived, we arranged the place and the necessary things for grilling food, 
                            we grilled together, bathed in the stream, ate the prepared food and joked around while bathing.<br> 
                            It was a very fun and relaxing weekend, bringing us closer.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. Traveling with a group has many advantages.<br> 
                            It usually saves money because people can share transport and accommodation costs.<br> 
                            It also feels safer and more comfortable when you are with friends.<br> 
                            Group trips are more enjoyable since you can share experiences, take photos together, and support each other.<br> 
                            Planning becomes easier because responsibilities are divided among the group.<br> 
                            For me, group travel creates good memories and improve friendships.<br>

                            3.	Why do people need to watch news?

                            1. In the picture there are two people standing close together. A woman who looks like a reporter is holding a microphone.<br> 
                            She is interviewing a man who is wearing a suit and tie. Both of them are dressed smartly and look professional.<br> 
                            The background is plain, so the focus is on the interview.<br> 
                            The scene gives a calm and serious feeling and makes me feel curious about the topic they are discussing.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            2. I prefer watching news on TV or online because it is faster and easier to follow.<br> 
                            I'm very busy because of working and studying, I often do not have much time to read long articles.<br> 
                            Short video clips or headlines give me quick updates I can watch between tasks.<br> 
                            However, when I need more details for work or my master's study, I sometimes read longer articles.<br> 
                            So I use both, but watching news fits my daily routine better.<br>
                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                            3. People need to watch the news to know what is happening locally and around the world.<br> 
                            News helps us make daily decisions, for example about travel, safety, or work plans.<br> 
                            It also keeps citizens informed about politics and social issues, which is important for participating in society.<br> 
                            For working, news helps us update new things related to our work and give useful information.<br> 
                            Finally, watching the news helps people feel connected to the wider world.<br>
