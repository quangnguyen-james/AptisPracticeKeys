            <h2>Reading Question 4 of 5: comments section of an online magazine article about eating.</h2>
            <p>Four people respond in the comments section of an online magazine article about eating. Decide whose opinion matches the statements below. Read the texts and complete the questions below.</p>
            <p><strong>Person A:</strong> As a child, I always enjoyed eating with friends, whether it was at family gatherings or simple meals after school. Sharing food was a way for me to bond with people, and it still brings back happy memories. I believe that the company makes the meal more enjoyable and turns any ordinary dish into a special occasion.</p>
            <p><strong>Person B:</strong> A few years ago, I used to eat out a lot, but I realized I needed to save money on eating. Now, I prefer to eat alone, where I can enjoy my meal in peace without distractions. Eating alone allows me to focus on the taste and quality of the food without the need for conversation.</p>
            <p><strong>Person C:</strong> Going to a restaurant is exciting because I like a wide variety of food, and I'm always eager to try new dishes from different cultures. I'm also taking a cookery course to improve my skills, so I can recreate some of my favorite meals at home and expand my culinary knowledge.</p>
            <p><strong>Person D:</strong> Fast food is nowhere near as good as home-cooked food because it feels healthier and more comforting than eating out. However, I just eat a few types of food, sticking to simple, familiar dishes that I know I'll enjoy. I'm not very adventurous when it comes to trying new things, but I appreciate the comfort of my favorite meals</p>

            <h2>Reading Question 5 of 5: CONSUMER AGE OF THE 20TH CENTURY</h2>
            <p>Read the passage quickly. Choose a heading for each numbered paragraph (1-7) from the drop- down box. There is one more heading than you need.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">1. [Making things last longer]</strong><br>
		        1. The movement towards making products last longer has gained momentum in response to environmental concerns and the negative impacts of consumerism. Emphasizing durability and quality over quantity, this shift encourages sustainable practices that reduce waste. As industries adapt to consumer demand for long- lasting products, a culture of mindfulness in consumption is emerging, promoting sustainability across various sectors.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">2. [A temporary experiment]</strong><br> 
		        2. The "consumer age" reflects a temporary societal experiment characterized by fast fashion and instant gratification, often prioritizing immediate satisfaction over long-term value. While this approach offers convenience, its unsustainable nature has led to environmental degradation and economic instability. As society faces these consequences, there's a growing need to reassess consumption patterns and adopt responsible practices for a sustainable future.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">3. [A reason for secrecy]</strong><br>
                3. Secrecy in the consumer age often masks the true costs of production, including environmental harm and labor exploitation, leading to consumer ignorance. This lack of transparency perpetuates irresponsible consumption habits. However, increasing consumer awareness is prompting calls for greater transparency in supply chains, encouraging companies to adopt more ethical practices that prioritize sustainability and accountability.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">4. [Still relevant in our times]</strong><br>
                4. The principles of responsible consumption and sustainability remain highly relevant today, particularly in light of ongoing climate challenges. Movements advocating for minimalism, recycling, and upcycling are gaining traction, promoting experiences over material goods. Educational initiatives are also raising awareness about the environmental impacts of consumption, underscoring the importance of informed choices in fostering a sustainable future.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">5. [The difficulty of being generous]</strong><br>
                5. Generosity can be difficult in a consumer-driven society where individual gain often overshadows collective well-being. This dilemma is compounded by societal norms prioritizing personal success. To foster a culture of generosity, individuals must recognize the value of collaboration and support, understanding that generosity benefits both individuals and their communities, ultimately leading to a more equitable society.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">6. [A reason for making a compromise]</strong><br>
                6. Compromise is essential in the consumer age, allowing individuals to balance personal desires with collective responsibilities. Consumers face dilemmas that require them to weigh convenience against environmental impact. By making conscious compromises-such as choosing sustainable brands or supporting local businesses-individuals can contribute to a sustainable future while enjoying the benefits of modern life.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">7. [Important lessons for us all]</strong><br>
                7. The consumer age imparts vital lessons about consumption, emphasizing that true value lies in quality and impact rather than quantity. By embracing sustainability, individuals can take responsibility for their choices and contribute to their communities. Lessons learned highlight the importance of transparency, collaboration, and generosity, encouraging consumers to prioritize practices that foster a sustainable and equitable future for all.</p>
