            <p>Four people respond in the comments section of an online magazine article about flying on airplanes. Decide whose opinion matches the statements below. Read the texts and complete the questions below.</p>
            <p><strong>Person A:</strong> I used to fly to Italy every summer for my wine trade, where I enjoyed relaxing while traveling and tasting some of the finest wines. For me, visiting vineyards and connecting with local producers was not just about business; it was a chance to unwind and appreciate the beautiful landscapes. My travels allowed me to immerse myself in different cultures, making my work even more fulfilling.</p>
            <p><strong>Person B:</strong> People find it strange that I dislike flying, especially as a travel blogger who frequently needs to fly for my work. Despite the excitement of discovering new destinations, I think that flying is a bad experience overall, with long security lines and cramped seats. I often share tips with my followers about finding alternative travel options, like road trips, that allow for more enjoyable and flexible adventures.</p>
            <p><strong>Person C:</strong> Personally, I have mixed feelings about flying. While I want to work as a tour guide in other countries to share my love for travel with others, I also dread the uncomfortable experience of air travel. I even suggest increasing the flight ticket price to reduce the number of flights, making travel a more thoughtful experience that allows people to appreciate their journeys.</p>
            <p><strong>Person D:</strong> My family live far from me, so I visit relatives regularly by plane. I know this is harmful for the environment but there are other things that I do in order to protect our nature.I usually walk or cycle to local grocery stores instead of driving, and I limit my use of plastic as much as possible. I believe that small actions, like these, contribute to a healthier planet and set a good example for my family.</p>

            <h2>Reading Question 5 of 5: The Golden Age of Tulip Trade</h2>
            <p>Read the passage quickly. Choose a heading for each numbered paragraph (1-7) from the drop-down box. There is one more heading than you need.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">1. [The economy during the Golden Age ]</strong><br>
		        1. During the period of the Dutch Golden Age, the port of Manchester was one of the wealthiest in all of Europe. This prosperity was in part due to the trade connections established by the Dutch East India Company, which transported luxury and exotic goods to Europe from Asia and beyond. Among the imported items, tulip bulbs made their way to Europe and quickly captured public attention, especially after their arrival in the bustling ports of the Netherlands. Tulips, with their striking colors and exotic appeal, soon became a symbol of status and luxury in Europe, especially as they gained popularity through trade at the prominent Manchester port.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">2. [ Coming into fashion ]</strong><br> 
		        2. In 1593, studies conducted at Dutch universities revealed that tulips could survive the cold European climate, an insight that fueled the flower's popularity. Their vibrant and diverse colors stood out against the more subdued tones of European flora, making tulips a unique spectacle. As they gained popularity, tulips became a symbol of wealth and status, particularly in the Netherlands. This popularity spread quickly across Europe, establishing tulips as a highly desirable commodity and solidifying their reputation as a status symbol among the European elite.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">3. [ An object of trade ]</strong><br>
                3. The demand for tulips surged, with collectors and merchants eagerly seeking the most colorful and unique blooms, Because tulips only bloomed during a limited season, from September to November, those who wanted tulips outside this window had to place orders in advance. This created a system of advance sales and pre-purchases, giving rise to a speculative market. This practice of pre-ordering tulips and trading contracts for their future delivery resembled modern-day options and futures trading in the financial markets, laying the groundwork for a complex market around these rare and exotic flowers.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">4. [ Different types of tulips ]</strong><br>
                4. Tulip values varied greatly, depending on their rarity and color. Multi-colored tulips, especially those with striking patterns, commanded higher prices than solid-colored varieties. Of particular interest were tulips affected by a viral infection that caused beautiful flame-like patterns on the petais, known as "broken" tulips. These rare blooms were highly valued for their unique appearance and sold for premium prices. Since tulips were also susceptible to disease, their fragility and exclusivity made them a prized commodity, as any remaining tulips became even more desirable.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">5. [ Trade mechanics ]</strong><br>
                5. As the tulip market grew, prices skyrocketed. Merchants often held onto their bulbs, waiting to sell at inflated prices. Between 1634 and 1637, the value of certain tulips rose by up to sixty times their original price. Speculators poured increasing amounts of money into tulips, driven by the hope of reselling them at even higher prices. The speculative nature of the market led to an economic bubble, where the price of tulips continued to rise without any intrinsic reason beyond collective belief in their value.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">6. [ Trade across Europe ]</strong><br>
                6. Tulip prices reached such extreme heights that they began to be traded on exchanges and even listed on stock markets. The general public, hoping to partake in the lucrative trade, flocked to purchase tulip bulbs. This speculative frenzy drew in a wide range of people, from merchants to commoners, all vying for a piece of what seemed like a guaranteed profitable investment. The tulip market became a cultural and economic phenomenon, with people from all backgrounds willing to invest their savings into tulips, expecting substantial returns.</p>
            <p><strong class="green-text">7. [ An unexpected turn of events ]</strong><br>
                7. However, this bustling tulip market eventually reached its breaking point. As with many speculative bubbles, the tulip craze was unsustainable, and prices eventually began to plummet. Once people realized that tulip prices had risen far beyond reasonable levels, panic selling ensued, and the market collapsed. The dramatic fall in prices left many investors in financial ruin, as the value of tulips dwindled to a fraction of their peak. The tulip mania became one of history's most famous economic bubbles, offering a cautionary tale about the dangers of speculation and the risks inherent in market bubbles.</p>
